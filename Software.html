          <h3>System software:</h3>
          <p>The system software is a collection of programs designed to operate, control, and extend the processing 
              capabilities of the computer itself. System software is generally prepared by the computer manufacturers.
               These software products comprise of programs written in low-level languages, which interact with the hardware 
               at a very basic level. System software serves as the interface between the hardware and the end users.
  <br>            Some examples of system software are Operating System, Compilers, Interpreter, Assemblers, etc.</p>

  <p><b>Here is a list of some of the most prominent features of a system software:</b></p>
  
  
  <ol class="unorder" >
      <li>Close to the system</li>
      <li>Fast in speed</li>
      <li>Difficult to design</li>
      <li>Difficult to understand</li>
      <li>Less interactive </li>
      <li>Smaller in size </li>
      <li>Difficult to manipulate</li>
      <li>Generally written in low-level language</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3 style="text-transform: lowercase;">Application Software:</h3>
  <p >Application software products are designed to satisfy a particular need of
       a particular environment. All software applications prepared in the computer 
       lab can come under the category of Application software.</p>
  <p>Application software may consist of a single program, such as Microsoft's 
      notepad for writing and editing a simple text. It may also consist of a 
      collection of programs, often called a software package, which work together
       to accomplish a task, such as a spreadsheet package.</p>
  <p>Examples of Application software are the following:</p>
  
  <ol class="unorder">
      <li>Google</li>
      <li>Microsoft Office</li>
      <li>Socal Media Apps</li>
  </ol>

  <p><b>Features of application software are as follows</b></p>
  <ol class="unorder">
      <li>Close to the user</li>
      <li>Easy to design</li>
      <li>More interactive</li>
