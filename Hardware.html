           <p><strong>Def:</strong>The System itself is the inner makings of the computer contained within the Chassis.
              The system consists of a combination of hardware and software coexisting in a symbiotic
              relationship. That is to use the hardware, a piece of software such as an Operating System
              (OS) or device driver is needed; vice versa, in order to use a piece of software, existence of
              compatible hardware is needed. A System must utilize 6 categories of components to classify
              it as a computer system.</p><br><br>
              <p>Here are some common individual computer hardware components that you'll often find inside a modern computer. These parts are almost always found inside the computer's case, so you won't see them unless you open the computer:</p>
              
              <ol class="list" >
                  <li> Motherboard</li>
                  <li title="Central processing unit">CPU</li>

              <h3 class="border">The Motherboard:</h3>
              <p>Even though the processor is the brain of the operation, without a Motherboard (MB)
                  all you will have is a cluster of components, which do not fit each other. Consider the
                  motherboard as the skeleton or a computer where parts, similar to human organs, fit within
                  it. </p>
              <img src="motherboard.jpg" alt="motherboard" class="pic">
              <p class="linehi">Although different manufacturers build different types of motherboards in a variety of
                  sizes, shapes and integrated features, all motherboards share some basic elements. All
                  motherboards must include an integrated chipset, which establishes the types of
                  components that are compatible with it. All MBs must accommodate at least 1 CPU,
                  capabilities for some type storage device, as well as some common input/output devices
                  such as keyboard and mouse which we’ll discussed later.
                  Every motherboard includes BIOS T (Basic Input/output System) chip, which performs
                  system checks at boot-up time of the system. The BIOS also provides the means of
                  communication between the processor and installed peripherals. Most BIOSes allow a
                  limited amount of customization such as power-saving functions and even password
                  protection for the system even before the operating system (OS) loads as a method of
                  protecting your computer from unauthorized users.</p><br><br><br><br>
      
                  <h3 class="border"title="Central processing unit"> CPU:</h3>
                  <p class="linehi">Also known as, “The Processor”, the CPU receives the user’s instructions from the
                      connected input devices, processes it and sends processed data to the appropriate components
                      and output devices. The CPU is where all complex calculations are carried out, as such the
                      faster the CPU the quicker the programs will function and respond. Intel’s Core™ i7
                      Extreme Edition 10-core processors,<img src="CPU.png" alt="CPU" class="pic"> AMD’s FX series 8-cores processors, AMD’s Phenom™
                      X4 Quad-Core are amongst the fastest processors on the market today. If you are looking for
                      blazing fast speed then you certainly want one of these processors. Without the CPU, the
                      whole computer is rendered useless</p>
                      
                      <p class="linehi">Like any piece of technology, CPUs come in all shape and sizes. There are 3 major aspects to
                          any CPU: </p>
                          <ol class="linehi">
                              <li>Type: There are different standards for a Processor to select from. Some of the most
                                  popular ones are Intel, AMD, and Motorola. </li>
                              <li> Class: Different classes have different minimum and maximum speeds. Some
                                  examples of Class are: i7, i5, i3, Celeron, Xeon, and Athlon.</li>
                              <li>Speed: Measured in Hertz, it is the speed at which calculations are processed.
                                  Examples of values are 4.0GHz and 1.2GHz</li>
                          </ol><br><br><br><br>
      
                          <h3 class="border">Internal Memory:</h3>
                          <p class="linehi">Every time an application is opened, the CPU allocates a specified amount of available
                              RAM space to provide faster reaction time to user commands within that application. RAM is
                              a temporary storage space meaning once the<img src="memory.jpg" alt="memory" class="pic"> application is done using the RAM space, it will
                              be once again available to be used by the next application that needs it. Once RAM’s capacity
                              is reached, the processor redirects its focus to available HDD space also referred to as Virtual
                              Memory (VM). It should be pointed out that HDDs are slower than RAM and as such once
                              your computer resorts to Virtual Memory, applications begin to slow down. As a rule of thumb, more
                               RAM allows you to run more applications simultaneously without slowing your
                              system’s performance.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
      
                              <h3 class="border">Power Supply:</h3>
                              <p class="linehi">A power supply is a hardware component that supplies power to an electrical device. It receives power from an
                                   electrical outlet and converts the current from AC (alternating current) to DC (direct current), which is what the computer
                                    requires. It also regulates the voltage to an adequate amount, which allows the computer to run smoothly without overheating.
                                     The power supply an integral part of any computer and must function correctly for the rest of the components to work.
      
                                  You can locate the power supply on a system unit by simply finding the input where the power cord is plugged in. Without opening
                                   your computer, this is typically the only part of the power supply you will see. If you were to remove the power supply, it
                                    would look like a metal box with a fan inside and some cables attached to it. Of course, you should never have to remove 
                                    the power supply, so it's best to leave it in the case.
                                    <img src="Power_supply.jpg" alt="Power Supply" class="pic">
                                  While most computers have internal power supplies, many electronic devices use external ones. For example, some monitors
                                   and external hard drives have power supplies that reside outside the main unit. These power supplies are connected directly 
                                   to the cable that plugs into the wall. They often include another cable that connects the device to the power supply. Some 
                                   power supplies, often called "AC adaptors," are connected directly to the plug (which can make them difficult to plug in 
                                   where space is limited). Both of these designs allow the main device to be smaller or sleeker by moving the power supply 
                                   outside the unit.
                                  
                                  Since the power supply is the first place an electronic device receives electricity, it is also the most vulnerable to 
                                  power surges and spikes. Therefore, power supplies are designed to handle fluctuations in electrical current and still 
                                  provide a regulated or consistent power output. Some include fuses that will blow if the surge is too great, protecting 
                                  the rest of the equipment. After all, it is much cheaper to replace a power supply than an entire computer. Still, it is 
                                  wise to connect all electronics to a surge protector or UPS to keep them from being damaged by electrical surges.</p>
                             
                                  <h3 class="border">GPU:</h3>
                                  <p class="linehi">The GPU is often integrated onto the motherboard or as an add-on video
                                      board inserted into motherboard slot connector. It give the system display capabilities. The
                                      video adapter turns the processed and translated user input, if any, along with any other
                                      information provided by an application and turns it into a video signal to be sent to a display
                                      device. Like any data in need of <img src="GPU.jpg" alt="GPU" class="pic">processing, this is done by utilizing the combined usage of
                                      system’ CPU and memory. More recent video adapters include onboard processor and
                                      memory to increase graphical processes such as those needed in games and applications used
                                      by photographers. Integrated video cards come with a blue jack to connect the monitor. Some
                                      add-on video adapters also include S-Video, Digital Video Input (DVI) and even Cable TV
                                      connectors.
